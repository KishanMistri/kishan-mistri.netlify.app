Kishan is a self-motivated, self-taught, and easygoing person fascinated by technological trends & big ideas & exciting to be doing the next project to apply and to experiment with things he learnt.

When he indulges into new stream of tech, he tries to absorb mostly used concepts and its application in real life. When it is for framework, he tries to get the most out of it by reading documentation along with pet project of expermentation. He likes to continue learning by doing side projects for solving a problem by using that technology. He has been started his journey with Crest Data Systems (Ahmedabad, India) and then switched to Oracle India Pvt Ltd (Bangalore, India) for further growth. In essence, his passion and joy along the journey brought him to industry. He is currently learning AI & ML and growing further. Thanks for reading Kmistri's intro.
