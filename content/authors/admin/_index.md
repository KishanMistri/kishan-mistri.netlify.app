My recent working experience was as a DevOps Engineer at Oracle, India with a total of 4+ years of professional experience in the Big Data technological and Data Analytics setting. My experience route includes a variety of roles and responsibilities such as an SRE, a Splunk Admin and Consultant to a DevOps Engineer, and automating system processes. I am currently working on his transition to the Data Science domain and doing the Post Grad Diploma in Applied Machine Learning with the University of Hyderabad.

I am self-motivated, knowledgable (guided by the ton of people that I admire), and an easygoing person fascinated by technology trends. When I indulges in a new tool or technique, I tries to absorb concepts and their application in real life. I also tries to create or integrate a pet project. I likes to continue learning by doing and integrating side projects for solving a problem.

Talking about Personal Stuff:

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm currently working on myself to achieve the milestone of successfully transitioning to ML and Data Science.

üöÄ I‚Äôm currently working on a few projects in parallel. [Stay Tuned..!]

üí¨ I am happy to help. Ask me about anything.
